====================
Extending the format
====================

The format is extended by adding new datasets to existing TimeSeries or Modules, or defining new TimeSeries and/or Interfaces. 
All that's required (recommended) is for the user/lab to provide documentation for those extensions when they share the file. 
When new TimeSeries or Interfaces extensions become popular, these can be added to the format specification. 
This approach allows extensibility without breaking compatibility.

==============
Data integrity
==============

HDF5 files can become corrupted if a write operation fails, such as through a tool/script crashing or being manually
closed when writing, or by power failure. This is not unique to HDF5, as other programs (e.g., MATLAB) can produce
corrupt files when they crash. A corrupted HDF5 file is effectively non-recoverable. 
There are plans to deal with this but they have not been implemented yet.
